Decent at Math and loves Physics, a right-brainer who loves being creative, and that ended-him-up choosing _Programming_ as his day-job. He loves what he does!

**Gopal S Akshintala** is currently a **Lead Software Engineer at Salesforce**, working on Scaling Backend Systems for Revenue Cloud.

He is a passionate developer and loves being an **Influencer & Mentor** in the Dev community through his [Blog-posts](/),
[International Tech-Talks](/my-talks), Social-media, and Open-Source.

In addition to his Software Engineering experience, Gopal gains more _experiences-per-year_ through open-source collaborations & contributions.
Gopal authored **3 Open-Source libraries**:
- [**ReVoman ü¶πüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è**](https://sfdc.co/revoman), a Template-Driven API Automation tool for JVM.

Gopal started as an Android Developer and switched to the server-side as a Full-Stack Developer (Backend ‚Äî Kotlin, Java | Frontend ‚Äî React Js).
Wearing multiple hats has helped him perceive Patterns, Solutions, and Trade-offs.
He is a practitioner of Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Clean Architecture and a massive fan of Demo-Driven Planning and Test-Driven Development (TDD).
He believes Expressive Code is fun and profitable, which enthused him towards Functional Programming (FP).
