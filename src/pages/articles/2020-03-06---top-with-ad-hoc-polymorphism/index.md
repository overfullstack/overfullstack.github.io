## Abstract

B2C microservices are built on heterogeneous tech-stacks (blocking/reactive) as per their traffic and can have common
use-cases E.g. Validation, Idempotency. But code can't be shared/reused due to paradigm contrast. So it's rewritten
everywhere. With a hands-on demo, let's see how to hasten feature development, by **Templatizing** code for large &
common & well-tested features, to be _shared/reused_ across heterogeneous services, using **Open-Source** technologies.

## Audience & Takeaways

Technical Level: Interesting to all, approachable for intermediate and up. Any Functional Programming enthusiasts love
it.

This talk targets intermediate to expert senior developers with a good understanding of `generics` and some
exposure/interest towards blocking and non-blocking/reactive paradigms. This talk is language-agnostic, but I
use **[Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) (a Modern Open-source JVM language)** in combination
with **[Arrow](http://arrow-kt.io/) (A Trending Open-source functional companion for Kotlin)**.

Kotlin's syntax is very close to Java, and all software design patterns discussed in this talk can be implemented in
almost any language. Thanks to the concise syntax of
Kotlin[$_{[2]}$](https://www.intuit.com/blog/uncategorized/kotlin-development-plan/) and robust toolset provided by
Arrow, implementing this technique turns ergonomic.

I used popular _open-source_ backend frameworks
-- `Spring-MVC`[$_{[3]}$](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/web.html#spring-web)
and `Spring-WebFlux`[$_{[4]}$](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/web-reactive.html)
to demonstrate heterogeneity, in my POC.

No prior knowledge about these frameworks or kotlin is required, all the nuances required for this problem are
contextually explained in the talk. The key takeaways for the audience are:

- How to create magic with the hot combination of open-source technologies -- _Spring Boot + Kotlin + Arrow_.
- The _Why, How & What_ of Monomorphic vs. Polymorphic code.
- Agile **B2C product development** teams, both in enterprises and startups, can learn ways to accelerate their feature
  development cycle, by converting large & common & well-tested features into reusable code templates, and how it is
  profitable and reduces the maintenance overhead of rewriting the same business logic across heterogeneous services and
  service migrations.

## Introduction

### The Case for Heterogeneous services

The trend in the B2C world is to chop the use-cases with varied traffic-needs into _Microservices/Macroservices_ managed
by independent Scrum teams. These teams develop using Heterogeneous frameworks and tech-stacks, suitable for the traffic
needs of their services.

Reactive/non-blocking stack[$_{[6]}$](https://www.reactivemanifesto.org/) should only be used for high traffic services,
as it adds a lot of complexity to the
application[$_{[7]}$](https://blog.pragmatists.com/unobvious-traps-of-spring-webflux-16924a0d76d5). Taking an example
from the Payments domain, Purchases tend to have high traffic (especially during Black Fridays, Flash sales, etc.), and
it's common to model them with an Asynchronous non-blocking stack like _Spring-WebFlux_. Whereas Refunds tend to have
relatively low traffic, and a simple blocking stack like _Spring-MVC_ can easily cater to its scaling needs. Such
use-cases can be found in many B2C products, E.g. Reservations vs. Cancellations.

### The problem of Reusability among Heterogeneous services

Despite being heterogenous, these services have many commonalities in their Domain logic, ranging from small features
such as Authentication, Logging, to large features such as Request-Validation, Idempotency, External-Integrations. In
the case of homogeneous services, the common code can be placed in a shared module and be added as a dependency in all
services. But in heterogeneous case, blocking code can't be shared/reused for non-blocking service or vice-versa,
because:

- It's extremely dangerous to mix both paradigms, as it can lead to untraceable performance issues.
- Their styles of programming are different (Functional in non-blocking vs. Imperative in blocking).
- Non-Blocking code is filled with callbacks while the blocking code is sequential.
- The DB APIs are different, as non-blocking services use non-blocking DBs.
- Each paradigm has specific `Effect` it operates on, E.g. Non-blocking paradigms may operate on reactive Effect types
  like `Mono<A>/Flux<A> or Observable<A>`, contrary to blocking paradigms which may (or need not) use simple Effect
  types like `Option/Either`.

This leads to scrum teams duplicating the same logic in all the services. Also, a service may be migrated, E.g.
from `Spring-MVC` to `Spring-WebFlux` to scale better for increasing traffic, it needs to be entirely rewritten.

Let’s see (with a working POC) how to make such common logic reusable/sharable, turning the Monomorphic code into
Polymorphic templates, which enables scrum teams to share well-tested small & large features across their services.

## Monomorphic to Polymorphic[$_{[8]}$](https://arrow-kt.io/docs/fx/polymorphism/)

If the Effect is abstracted out as a _Generic_, the domain logic turns reusable for service of any type, and it can be
called **Polymorphic**. But to achieve that, we need to understand the concepts - **Higher-Kinded Types** and **
Typeclasses**.

### Need for Higher-Kinded Types[$_{[9]}$](https://arrow-kt.io/docs/patterns/glossary/#higher-kinds)

Effects are of the form `F<A>` (e.g. `Mono<A>`), where `F` is the _Effect_ type and `A` is the value type. The problem
is, most JVM languages only support parametricity on the value type `A` but not on the Container/Effect type `F`. So, we
need **Higher-Kinded Types**, to represent `F<A>` as `Kind<F, A>`.

### Need for Typeclasses[$_{[10]}$](https://arrow-kt.io/docs/patterns/glossary/#typeclasses)

It's a generic interface that is parametric on a Type `T`. E.g. `Comparator<T>` in JDK is a simple
typeclass. `Comparator<T>` has one operation `fun compare(a: T?, b: T?): Int`. Now for a type `String` to be a member of
this typeclass, prepare a concrete `Comparator<String>` implementing its `fun compare(a: String?, b: String?): Int`.
That's it! Now the `Collections.sort()` can make use of this concrete implementation to compare Strings.

To put our above example into a formal definition - A type class defines some behavior in the form of operations that
must be supported by a type. A type can be a member of a typeclass by merely providing implementations of the operations
the type must support.

This principle can be used to define abstract interfaces like `Comparator<T>` and reusable templates
like `Collections.sort()`, whose behavior is polymorphic to the type `T` being sorted. This is called **Ad-hoc
Polymorphism**. There is a popular OOP Design pattern which uses this technique, known as **Template Method** pattern.

The term **Ad-hoc polymorphism** refers to polymorphic functions that can be applied to arguments of different types,
but that behave differently depending on the type of the argument to which they are applied.

The code that relies on type classes is open for extension, just like how `Comparator<T>` can be extended to compare any
type.

## Template-Oriented-Programming with a POC

Now that we have both the tools (Higher-Kinded Types and Typeclasses), let’s make a polymorphic template for our
reusable domain logic. The samples used in the rest of this paper can be seen in action in a fully working POC
- [GitHub](https://github.com/overfullstack/ad-hoc-poly). It has 3 modules:

- `kofu-mvc-validation` - Blocking Service built
  with `Spring-WebMVC`[$_{[3]}$](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/web.html#spring-web)
- `kofu-reactive-validation` - Reactive Service built
  with `Spring-WebFlux`[$_{[4]}$](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/web-reactive.html)
- `validation-templates` - Shared module for both the services, holding templates.

We shall take-up the **_user validate-and-upsert_** as our example use-case, where a request to upsert a user is **_
validated_**, followed by **_insert or update_** based on the user's existence in the DB.

`Spring-WebFlux` works with `Mono<A>/Flux<A>` while `Spring-WebMVC` doesn't. As a proof for lack-of reusability problem
discussed above, notice how `upsert` function is different in both the services, although doing the same functionality
- [WebMVC Ref](https://github.com/overfullstack/ad-hoc-poly/blob/f06b25a/kofu-mvc-validation/src/main/kotlin/mvc/Handlers.kt#L24-L43)
and [WebFlux Ref](https://github.com/overfullstack/ad-hoc-poly/blob/f06b25a/kofu-reactive-validation/src/main/kotlin/reactive/Handlers.kt#L25-L51)
.

The goal is to abstract this use-case domain logic into a generic reusable template. We shall achieve it by creating
some typeclasses and making use of some typeclasses from the Arrow library. These heterogeneous services can inflate and
consume these templates by supplying concrete instances of those typeclass interfaces. I coined this technique as **
Template-Oriented-Programming!**

### The `Repo<F>` typeclass

Let's abstract the DB behavior in both these stacks to a generic typeclass interface, `Repo<F>`, where `F` represents
the Effect-type on which the DB works in their respective stacks/paradigms.

```kotlin:title=Repo.kt
interface Repo<F> : Async<F> {
    fun User.update(): Kind<F, Unit>
    fun User.insert(): Kind<F, Unit>
    fun User.doesUserLoginExist(): Kind<F, Boolean>
    fun User.isUserCityValid(): Kind<F, Boolean>
}
```

- These operations have a return type of the form `Kind<F, A>`(=`F<A>`), which is generic and agnostic of the `Effect`.
- The `Repo<F>` inherits from `Async<F>`, which is a typeclass from Arrow Library to represent _Effectful Operations_.
- Our services implement `Repo<F>` typeclass with their respective Effect types.
- In these concrete implementations, `IO` and `MonoK` supply concrete instances for `Async<F>`, and the service
  repository functions are mapped to `Repo` operations
  - [WebMVC Ref](https://github.com/overfullstack/ad-hoc-poly/blob/f06b25a/kofu-mvc-validation/src/main/kotlin/mvc/Configurations.kt#L34-L43)
  and [WebFlux Ref](https://github.com/overfullstack/ad-hoc-poly/blob/f06b25a/kofu-reactive-validation/src/main/kotlin/reactive/Configurations.kt#L24-L33)
  .

### Templates using Typeclasses

Now we can weave our business-logic into generic templates depending on the generic operations of the
typeclass `Repo<F>`. **Templates** are generic functions and they depend on Typeclasses. This dependency can be achieved
by passing typeclass as a function argument or declaring the template functions as extensions to a typeclass. I used the
latter in my POC
- [Ref](https://github.com/overfullstack/ad-hoc-poly/blob/f06b25a/validation-templates/src/main/kotlin/top/rules/UserRules.kt)
. This file has all the validation rules for a user. The typeclass here is `EffectValidator<F, S, ValidationError>`,
which in-turn is composed of two typeclasses `ValidatorAE<S, E>` (abstracts Validation Strategies) and `Repo<F>` (
Discussed above). The generics in these typeclasses stand for:

- F : Effect type - Used by `Repo<F>` to signify the effect in which the DB operates.
- S : Strategy type - Used to decide the strategy in which validations should run (e.g. Fail-Fast or Error-Accumulation)
  .

However, these User-rules are generic functions aka _Templates_, which are agnostic of validation orchestration
strategy (`S`) and the paradigm Effect (`F`) in which these are triggered (blocking/reactive). This can also be seen
from the return types of these functions - `Kind<F, Kind<S, Boolean>>`.

### How services consume templates

- To consume these templates, the `EffectValidator<F, S, ValidationError>` typeclass acts as the bridge between services
  and templates.
- The concrete implementations of the typeclass supplied by Services, essentially fill in the blanks for the templates.
- These templates work as shared logic, and the services can use those concrete instances to consume all these
  templates.
- Refer how both the services are able to seamlessly call the validation templates using the concrete instances without
  rewriting the rules and orchestration:
  - WebMVC Ref
    - [This](https://github.com/overfullstack/ad-hoc-poly/blob/f06b25a/kofu-mvc-validation/src/main/kotlin/mvc/Handlers.kt#L24-L55)
    is replaced
    with [This](https://github.com/overfullstack/ad-hoc-poly/blob/f06b25a/kofu-mvc-validation/src/main/kotlin/mvc/HandlersX.kt#L18-L31)
  - WebFlux Ref
    - [This](https://github.com/overfullstack/ad-hoc-poly/blob/f06b25a/kofu-reactive-validation/src/main/kotlin/reactive/Handlers.kt#L18-L63)
    is replaced
    with [This](https://github.com/overfullstack/ad-hoc-poly/blob/f06b25a/kofu-reactive-validation/src/main/kotlin/reactive/HandlersX.kt#L19-L35)
    .

### Loose Coupling

Sharing code among micro-services is seen as an anti-pattern as it causes tight-coupling and eager-abstractions. But,
this is specific to *Parallel* services like Payments-Refunds, Reservations-Cancellations etc., which share a lot of
domain logic and is not bound to change. Plus, this is sharing at granular level. As discussed above, these templates
are **Extensions** of typeclass and services (consumers) are the ones, which breathe life into them. That means, any new
service or service migration can pick and borrow and extend at granular level, all those well-tested small and large
features for _free_ with minor efforts! Moreover, typeclasses are entirely extensible to support more operations, in
turn, to extend and expand our template base.

> ⚠️ A word of caution, this technique should **NOT** be misused on the name of DRY to abstract duplication everywhere. Always, give the duplicate code some time to settle and evolve. 👯‍♂️

## Outcomes and Conclusions

We achieved reusable domain logic using Ad-hoc Polymorphism, abstracting out the Effect using Typeclasses and
Higher-Kinded Types, turing our Monomorphic code to Polymorphic. This is very powerful to model and migrate Parallel
B2C-services. This **zeros-down the cost and effort** to rewrite and maintain common business logic across all services
and service migrations. This can save a release cycle amount of work, increases project stability, bringing in real
agility among scrum teams and startups to ship features faster. All of this is achieved with **Free & Open-Source**
technologies.
